# Apartment-List
1. A simple GUI has been provided.
2. I have used a text file to store the names called Employees.txt. Initially, I would load the names into an ArrayList.
3. If the user wants to add a name, he/she can simply enter the name in the text field and hit the "Add Name" button.
   This will add the name to both the array and Employees.txt
4. When the user is ready to generate the groups, he/she can simply hit the "Group Em" button. And the groups will be
   outputted onto the command line.
5. I've decided to group the employees into the most number of groups of 3 possible. Anyone left out will be added to
   different groups. This way I can make sure that there are at least 3 people in a group and will not ever reach more
  than 5 people.
